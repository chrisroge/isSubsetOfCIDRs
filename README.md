IP Range to CIDR Notations Conversion and CIDR Subset Check
Welcome to the IP Range to CIDR Notations Conversion and CIDR Subset Check project! We've been hard at work converting IP ranges to CIDR notations and checking if one list of CIDR notations is a subset of another list.

We started by analyzing the IP range 80.80.80.10 - 80.80.80.40, and we came up with the following CIDR notations: 80.80.80.10/31, 80.80.80.12/30, 80.80.80.16/28, 80.80.80.32/29, and 80.80.80.40/32. Then, we expanded our analysis to include the IP range 80.80.80.60 - 80.80.80.90, and we came up with even more CIDR notations: 80.80.80.60/30, 80.80.80.64/28, 80.80.80.80/29, 80.80.80.88/31, and 80.80.80.90/32. We were able to combine all the CIDR notations into a single array for easy reference.

But that wasn't enough for us. We decided to take things to the next level and write a JavaScript function to check if one list of CIDR notations is a subset of another list. We made sure the function was compatible with the ServiceNow San Diego version, so we can use it in our ServiceNow instance. The function is easy to use and should save us a lot of time in the future.

So, what have we learned from this project? Well, for starters, CIDR notation is a really useful way to represent IP ranges. It allows us to condense a large range of IP addresses into a single notation, which makes it easier to manage and reference. And if we need to check if one list of CIDR notations is a subset of another list, we can use the handy JavaScript function we wrote.

But most importantly, we learned that with a little bit of humor and a lot of hard work, we can accomplish anything. Thanks for joining us on this journey, and we hope you learned something new!
